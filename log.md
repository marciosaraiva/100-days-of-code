# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I always told my students to solve URI Online Judge exercises, but I never did many exercises there. In this "100 Days Code" challenge, I promised myself that I will solve all the "beginner exercises" (which I recommend for students). There are currently 303 exercises, so I will try to solve 3 exercises every day to complete my goal.

### Day 1: October 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** I will do all the exercises, from the easiest to the hardest from URI Online Judge. For now, it's very easy! Just exercises with basic math operations.

### Day 2: October 02, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises on URI Online Judge.

**Thoughts** Another quiet day. However, I noticed that some exercises need more attention when reading the description.

### Day 3: October 03, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More 4 exercises.

**Thoughts** Today I did 4 exercises because if I do only 3 exercises every day I will not complete the challenge in 100 days.

### Day 4: October 04, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I kept doing URI exercises.

**Thoughts** Finally I started asking questions I never asked. It's getting nicer.
