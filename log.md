# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I always told my students to solve URI Online Judge exercises, but I never did many exercises there. In this "100 Days Code" challenge, I promised myself that I will solve all the "beginner exercises" (which I recommend for students). There are currently 303 exercises, so I will try to solve 3 exercises every day to complete my goal.

### Day 1: October 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** I will do all the exercises, from the easiest to the hardest from URI Online Judge. For now, it's very easy! Just exercises with basic math operations.

### Day 2: October 02, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises on URI Online Judge.

**Thoughts** Another quiet day. However, I noticed that some exercises need more attention when reading the description.
